    <p>
      Following nearly a decade of work as a graphic designer, both as a freelancer and working in conjunction with Stephens Creative, I have built a body of work of which I am extremely proud of. My experience designing and assisting companies to establish their brand is my strongest asset, but my dedication to client satisfaction and my time overseeing others in the completion of design projects also reflect on the experience I have accumulated over the years.

            <h3>Code Refractoring</h3>
            <p>
              In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior.

      <h3>CSS Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

      <h3>Learning Javascript</h3>
      <p>
      JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
